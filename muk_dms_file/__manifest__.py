        This module extends MuK Documents to use the local file system to store and load files.
        
        I case you want to change the save type of an existing Root Setting be aware that this
        can trigger a heavy migration process, depending on how many files are currently stored.
        
        Before you start the migration process make sure the following conditions are met:
            - no one else is using the system at the time of migration
            - no files are locked either by the system or users
            - Odoo has writing rights to the given directory path
